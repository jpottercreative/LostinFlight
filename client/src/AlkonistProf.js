        <p>
        You truly are great, half human - half bird, your song is so enchanting it causes those around you to forget earthly desires and want nothing more as long as they live. Your powers are not only known to the realm of humans, nature too acknowledges your strength, hurling waves across the seas to protect your nascent young as they emerge from their shell on the beaches of the paradise you call home.  Be aware, your counterpart the Sirin may need your help - are you prepared to show your greatness?
