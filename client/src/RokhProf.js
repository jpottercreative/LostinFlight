        You are a Rokh! This enormous bird of prey is known for its strength and assertiveness in action. This bird appears in Asian mythology and Indian Sanskrit epics, derived from the Spanish word “rocho”. Strong enough to carry small elephants, this bird is praised for saving sailors stranded at sea. However, if crossed, there will be vengeance to follow.
