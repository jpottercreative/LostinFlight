        <p> 
            The Phoenix is an immortal bird with a cyclical life span; it ages, dies, then is reborn from its ashes.  Associated with the sun and new beginnings, the phoenix is associated with resilience, ambition, and bravery.  The word ‘phoenix’ was used in 12th century English to describe an ‘excellent person’.
    <br></br>
             Younger variations of this personality may display the negative qualities of these traits, with ambition translating to brash impulsiveness, and bravery as arrogance, but the phoenix’s innate sense of curiosity and desire for improvement allows these to be quickly refined.  Natural leaders and pioneers of change, the phoenix may often be found questioning systems, in quickly rising industries, or inspiring those around them.
